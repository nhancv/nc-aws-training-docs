IAM
Identity policies attached to IAM users, roles, or groups can include S3 elements.
Resource policies apply to a resource. They can be used to authorize access to a bucket or objects inside a bucket to large numbers of identities. Bucket policies can also apply to anonymous accesses (public access).
IAM Roles => Create role that the trusted entiry (service/another AWS account/Web identity/SAML) keep the specific policies of resources (AWSS3FullAccess, AWSDynamoFullAccess, ...) to use the appropriate resources  
AWS SSO automatically creates IAM roles in each assigned account for each permission set, and configures these roles with a maximum session duration of 12 hours.

AWS Organisation
+ SCP will block access to Amazon S3 bucket to all accounts within Singapore region including root users of each accounts within AWS Organisation & not to users outside this region who have access to S3 bucket.
+ For accounts which are part of AWS Organisation, Resource sharing can be done on an individual account basis in case resource sharing is not enabled at AWS Organisation level.  With this, resources are shared within accounts as external accounts & an invitation needs to be shared between these accounts to start resource sharing.
+ For sharing AWS Resources with AWS Resource Access Manager, sharing needs to be enabled with the master account of AWS Organisation. Only resources that are owned by the account are shared with other accounts & resources are not re-shared from other accounts.
+ SCP policy, other instance types may be allowed as well since by default an AWS Organization has an SCP that allows full AWS access => Use Effect "Deny" not "Allow"
+ Resource Access Manager is an AWS service to centrally manage resources so that you can easily specify which accounts or Organizations can access the resources.

AWS CloudFormation 
+ Drift Detection can be used to detect changes made to AWS resources outside the CloudFormation Templates. AWS CloudFormation Drift Detection only checks property values that are explicitly set by stack templates or by specifying template parameters. It does not determine drift for property values that are set by default. To determine drift for these resources, you can explicitly set property values which can be the same as that of the default value.

Vertical scaling is achieved by adding additional resources in the form of CPU or memory to an existing machine.
Horizontal Scaling is achieved by adding additional machines into a pool of resources, each of which provides the same service

DynamoDB
+ DynamoDB Stream: listen change on DynamoDB Table and trigger AWS Lambda function
DynamoDb read/write calculation and GSI (Global Secondary Index) vs LSI (Local Secondary Indexes)
Read Capacity Unit (RCU) = 4KB in strongly consistent mode, and 2 reads of 4KB per seconds for 1 RCU in default mode (eventual mode) => need / 2 to get eventual RCU as default
Provisioned Throughput Calculations
A system needs to store 60 patient records of 1.5 KB, each, every minute. What WCU should you allocate on the patient record table?
- 60 records per minute = ~1 per second (and the DDB RCU/WCU buffer can smooth this out if not)
- Each record is 1.5 KB. 1 WCU = 1 KB per second, so each record requires 2 WCU.
- A WCU setting of 2 is required on the table.
A weather application reads data from a DynamoDB table. Each item in the table is 7 KB in size. How many RCUs should be set on the table to allow for 10 reads per second?
- 1 item is 7KB, which is 2 RCU(1RCUis4KB).
- 10 reads per second for 7 KB items = 20 RCU
- But the question didn't specify if eventual or strong
consistency is required. The default is eventual, which allows
for 2 reads of 4 KB per second for 1 RCU.
- Assuming eventually consistent reads, the answer is 10 RCU.
------
Read → 4kb; Write → 1 kb
Tính ra per seconds
number of rows x (round of 4kb/1kb)
Read : eventual = RCU / 2
Eg: 100 items, each item cost 1.5kb per seconds ? How many read provision need ?
=> 100 x 4 = 400 read provision / 2

CloudFront
+ Using Origin Access Identity (OAI) to prevent user view files directly with S3 url using object ACL's

Cached volumes:  – You store your data in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and retain a copy of frequently accessed data subsets locally. Cached volumes offer substantial cost savings on primary storage and minimize the need to scale your storage on-premises. You also retain low-latency access to your frequently accessed data.
Stored volumes:  – If you need low-latency access to your entire dataset, first configure your on-premises gateway to store all your data locally. Then asynchronously back up point-in-time snapshots of this data to Amazon S3.

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) layer 7 -> 1: Application -> Presentation -> Session -> Transport -> Network -> Data Link -> Physical
At Layer 1 (Physical), networks use a shared medium where devices can transmit signals and listen
Layer 2 (Data Link) adds MAC addresses (01-23-45-67-89-AB-CD-EF) that can be used for named communication between two devices on a local network.
The Network Layer (L3) allows for unique device-to-device communication over interconnected networks. L3 devices can pass packets over tens or even hundreds of L2 networks. 
L4 (Transport) adds TCP and UDP. TCP is designed for reliable transport,and UDPisaimed at speed.TCPusessegmentsto ensure data is received in the correct order and adds error checking and "ports," allowing different streams of communications to the same host (e.g., tcp/22 and tcp/80).
L5 (Session) adds the concept of sessions, so that request and reply communication streams are viewed as a single "session" of communication between client and server.
L6 (Present at ion) adds data conversion, encryption, compression, and standards that L7 can use. 
L7 (Applicat ion) is where protocols (such as HTTP, SSH, and FTP) are added. For example, HTTP (L7) running over TLS (L6) is HTTPS.
Class A (/8): 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 ? 126 networks, 16,777,214 nodes in each (+2 reserved)
Class B (/16): 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255 ? 65,534 nodes in each (+2 reserved).
Class C (/24): 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255 ? 254 nodes in each (+2 reserved)
IP classes have a number of ranges within them used for private networking only:
- 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255: Private networking within the Class A range
- 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255: Private networking within the Class B range (16 Class B networks)
- 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255: Private networking within the Class C range (256 Class C networks)
Local device-to-device communication takes place using L1 (Physical) and L2 (Data Link) using MAC addresses and physical 0's and 1's.

Amazon CloudFront is a global service for which events are delivered to CloudTrail trails which include global services. To avoid duplicate Amazon CloudFront events, you can disable these events from delivering to CloudTrail trails in all regions & enable in only one region using AWS CLI
CloudFront Query String Forwarding only supports Web distribution. For query string forwarding, the delimiter character must be always a '&' character. Parameters' names and values used in the query string are case sensitive.
Lexicons are specific to a region. You will need to upload Lexicon in each region where you need to use it. For a single text which appears multiple times in the content, you can create an alias using multiple Lexicons to have different speech.
Using SSML tags, we can control the speech generated by Amazon Polly. In the above example, using SSML tags, convert commas to period & tag words and paragraphs as “Strong”, will help to control the speech speed, adds appropriate pause & emphasis on appropriate words slowing speaking rate.
If you need an AMI across multiple regions, you have to copy the AMI across regions. Note that, by default, AMIs that you have created will not be available across all regions.
Enable Cross-Region snapshots for the Redshift Cluster.
You can use Amazon Polly to generate speech from either plain text or from documents marked up with Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). Using SSML-enhanced text gives you additional control over how Amazon Polly generates speech from the text you provide.
Since by default, EBS Volumes are replicated within their Availability Zones.

The IT Team is looking for your consultation for this issue without incurring additional cost or compromising on security. Which of the following actions is recommended for resolution?
-> Store objects in JSON format compressing it with GZIP using server-side encryption. Use Amazon S3 Select to retrieve a subset of data.
The Developers Team is working on a new application for which they will be launching a large number of EC2 Instance. To decrease time in launching all these EC2 instances they want you to pre-warm these instances & keep ready for launching with all required patches & software. Which of the following can be done to meet this requirement?
-> Launch an Amazon EC2 instance with Amazon EBS root volume & enable Hibernate.
You have two AWS Organizations. All the AWS accounts in Organization A need to be moved to Organization B. You have already moved all the member accounts and now you need to migrate the master account. Which of the following options should you choose?
-> Delete Organization A and invite the master account to join Organization B.

If you want notifications about log file delivery and validation, you can set up Amazon SNS notifications.

S3 policy for Cloud Front
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity XXXX1234567890"
    },
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::aws-example-bucket/*"
}

Security review: using CloudTrail and CloudWatch
After you enable CloudTrail log file integrity, it will create a hash file called digest file which refers to logs that are generated. This digest file is saved in different folder in S3 bucket where log files are saved. Each of these digest files has the private key of public & private key pair. The DIgest file can be validated using the public key. This feature ensures that all the modifications made to CloudTrail log files are recorded.

AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud. With CloudHSM, you can manage your own encryption keys using FIPS 140-2 Level 3 validated HSMs
Network Load Balancer can be used to terminate TLS connections instead of back end instance reducing load on this instance. With Network Load Balancers, millions of  simultaneous sessions can be established with no impact on latency along with preserving client IP address. To negotiate TLS connections with clients, NLB uses a security policy which consists of protocols & ciphers.
Network Load Balancer requires one certificate per TLS connection to encrypt traffic between client & NLB , & forward decrypted traffic to target servers. Using  AWS Certificate Manager is a preferred option, as these certificates are automatically renewed on expiry.
