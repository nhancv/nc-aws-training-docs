High Availability: Hardware, software, and configuration allowing a system to recorver quickly in the event of a failure
Fault Tolerance: System designed to operate through a failure with no user impact. More expensive and complex to achieve
Recovery Point Objective (RPO): How much a business can tolerate to lose, expressed in time. The maximum time between a failure and the last successful backup.
Recovery Time Objective (RTO): The maximum amount of time a system can be down. How long a solution takes to recorver.

Vertical scaling is achieved by adding additional resources in the form of CPU or memory to an existing machine. By doing so, the machine is able to service additional customers or perform compute tasks quicker. Eventually, maximum machine sizes will constrain your ability to scale - either technically or from a cost perspective
Horizontal Scaling is achieved by adding additional machines into a pool of resources, each of which provide the same service. Horizontal scaling suffers none of the size limitations of vertical scaling and can scale to nearly infinite levels but requires application support to scale effectively.
