- What is one key difference between a global secondary index and a local secondary index?
=> A local secondary index must have the same partition key as the main table

- How many secondary indexes (global and local combined) are allowed per table? (by default)
=> You can define up to 5 local secondary indexes and 20 global secondary indexes per table (by default) - for a total of 25.

- How many tables can an AWS account have per region?
=> The current default limit is 256 per region. Table limits can be increased by contacting AWS.

Let us suppose, we specify a value for Reservoir Rate as 60, and Fixed Rate as 20. Now, if your application receives 200 requests in a second, then the total number of requests that would be traced or sampled will be: - 
"Reservoir Rate" + Fixed Rate % [(Total Requests - Reservoir Rate)] 
- 60 + (200-60) * 20%
- 60 + 28 
- 88
